# Machine-Learning-Classifiers-from-Scratch
Code for my exam "Computational Methods of Physics", in which several machine learning classifiers are recreated:1. Perceptron;
2. Adaline;
3. Logistic Regression;
4. Support Vector Machine (with Linear and RBF/Gaussian Kernel);
5. Neural Network.
The program is not optimized and for more than 1000 epochs is very slow, because the main objective is to be understandable by anyone.
Made by a beginner for beginners.
